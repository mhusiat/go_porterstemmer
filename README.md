#### Go implementation of the stemming algorithm by Porter (1980) ####

Code based on the paper by Porter (1980) as well as the resources at https://tartarus.org/martin/PorterStemmer/
(online resources contain additional differences from the original algorithm).

The algorithm fully passes the tests available at the same page; to run the test,
download voc.txt and output.txt files from the link above and run porterstemmer_tests.go.
